File Management

    Linux uses files for virtually everything

    From storing configuration settings to access remote network resources to communicating
    with hardware devices, all of this is done through files.

    In Linux we have 2 types of files:

        system files

        and

        user files
    
    Files are not alike for instance documents created using 
    the Write application are not as critical to the system as the
    /etc/passwd file for instance

    Modifying a user file won't break stuff similarly to Modifying
    a system file (which can bring the system down)

    For this reason, the critical files (the system files) are protected
    fron accidental (or intentional) altering. On the other hand, files
    created by users (user files) can be modified or deleted by their
    owners;

    Example of system files:

        Startup scripts (files that launch services -called daemons- when
        the OS boots)
            *daemons are launched by startup scripts (other example of a 
            system file)

        Program files (used by the installed software)

        Secondary program files: icons, images, fonts, which support the main software

        System configuration files (they contain config that defines how the
        system works)

        Files that contain important data (user info/passwords)
            *database files (e.g. /etc/passwd file)

        Event-logging files (system activity is logged in these)



        Who can work with the system files?

        System files are protected from regular users. Only the root user can change them.

            Even when owning a system, it is recommended/good practice to use a regular
            user account and access the root priviledges only when installing/uninstallign software
            or configuring one or some of the system files


        The FileSystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

        Linux has many flavours but there is a standard location for all important files

        the FHS classifies files based on the following:

            2 types of files:

                    Shareable (can be shared across multiple systems)

                    and

                    non-Shareable (they contain info specific to the system like the IP address, hostname, etc..)


            2 types of 'variability'

                    Variable files (files that can be changed either by the system or by users -> e.g. log files)

                    and

                    non-Variable files (files that are not likely to change like program binaries)

                        *a file may fall into any combination of the above categories
