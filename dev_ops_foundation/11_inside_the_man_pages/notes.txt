Inside the man pages

    running in terminal 'apropos' + cmd gives us all entries in the man pages containing the
    respective command

    e.g. 
        apropos hash
        apropos grep
        etc..

    similar command is man -k
    
    e.g.
        man -k hash
        man -k grep
        etc...

    man-pages can be navigated with the arrow keys (1 line) or with pagedown/spacebar
    ctr+f (scroll down 1 page) or ctr+b (scroll 1 page back)

    searching for a word in man pages:
        type /word while inside the man page (e.g /sort will search for sort)

        press n to go from 1 occurence to the next

    man-page drawbacks:
        absence of hyperlinks
        
    
    the info pages try to fix the drawbacks from the man pages (e.g. they have hyperlinks)

    info pages work like a node tree

    type info cmd to get the info page (e.g. info ls)

    note while inside the info page I can navigate with the arrows and go on a link 
        the cursor will blink when I am on the link and if I hit enter, it takes me to the
        respective page

    press u to go up to the initial page

    press n to move forward in the list of links (press p to go back)
        if I have links:

            link a
            link b
            link c
        
        and I am on link b page (press n and it takes me to page c, press u and it takes me
        back to link b page)
