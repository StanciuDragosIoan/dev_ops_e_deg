The man pages:

    man stands for manual. Most cmds we will use on the command line have a 'manual'
    that explains their usage and various options

    in order to display the man page of a cmd type the cmd and then a space and then man

    e.g. man grep

    besides cmds in man pages we can have configuration files, libraries, etc.. referenced
    and explained

    the man pages consist of 9 sections:

        1.executable shell commands
        2.kernel system calls
        3.library calls
        4.device files
        5.file formats
        6.games
        7.miscellaneous, character set standards, etc..
        8.system management and administration commands (like mount)
        9.kernel function	

    if we type in man passwd (cmd to reset a user's password) we get section 1 of the manual
    printed

    if we type in man 5 passwd (we get section 5), etc..

    man mount (displays section 8 directly)

    Searching the man pages faster
        type whatis and cmd:
            whatis grep (shows in 1 line what grep does)
