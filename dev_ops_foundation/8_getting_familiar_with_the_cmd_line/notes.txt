Getting familiar with the command line

	a lot of functionality in linux can be done through the GUI, but power users
	preffer the cmd line to perform the tasks more quickly and more efficiently


	everything in the GUI can be done through the cmd line

	cmd line will offer more options/ways to execute a program

	we can put multiple programs in a shell script (a file containing multiple intructions that
	get executed 1 after another) ->good way to automate tasks

	we can open a terminal from the system or connect remotely with a client like putty

		ls (cmd) displays the content of the current directory

		ls /var (displays the contents of the var directory)

		pwd (print working directory)

		cd .. (move to parent directory)

		cd ../.. (move 2 directories up)

		launch firefox /usr/bin/firerox (or simply type firefox)
			the 'firefox' cmd works thanks to the path variable (which contains that)

		echo $PATH (display path)
			the path var contains the locations in which the system will look when we type
			a cmd that is not in its full path

			when I type firefox, browser starts because the location where fiirefox is installed is in the $PATH var:
		
	/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
	*usr/bin is there in the $PATH

	*the system will look for the directories in the $PATH var in order 
		first will look in usr/local/sbin, then in usr/local/bin, then usr/sbin, then usr/bin,
		etc... so for instance having 2 programs installed with the same name in 2 different 
		locations in the $PATH, the first one will be ran first 

	the ./test.sh (the . cmd refers to the current path -where I currently am in the folder structure)
	otherwise for test.sh I'd have to run specifying the full path)

 

	The filesystem tree in Linux:

		I have the root: /
			Under root I have directories like /home, /var, /media, etc..
				Under these I have the users home/dragos, the logs home/log and	/media/cdrom
