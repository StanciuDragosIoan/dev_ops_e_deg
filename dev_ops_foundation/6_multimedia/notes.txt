Linux as a server

	This is where the real power of linux is manifested. All servers use a linux/unix 
	distribution.

	A server = may refer to 2 things:
		
		1. a program that runs in the background and serves some service or function to a 
		number of users

		2. a machine that does this task

	For instance a web server can refer to both a program and a machine

	Apache HTTPD: one of the most popular webservers on the internet (used with the LAMP stack)

	Nginx: newer than apache (1995) nginx was released in 2002 (system admins usually preffer 
	to use both apache and nginx - apache is powerful when serving dynamic content while nginx 
	is powerful when serving static content)

	static vs dynamic 

		(dynamic serves content on the fly, the page is created when I visit it)

		(static means a static file - it is saved on the server and it is served when I visit 
		the website)



Software management:

	Ubuntu Software center 
		this has many programs that we might need, all the programs in the ubuntu repos

	apt-get
		used to download and install programs and packages from repositories (a repo is like
		a website used to download packages - they are made and maintained by the vendor e.g.
		ubuntu repo is maintained by ubuntu and software can be downloaded either from the 
		ubuntu software or with apt-get cmd)

		apt-get takes cares of dependencies (will download and install dependencies too before 
		installing the program)


	dpkg
		program used to install the software (it is a low lvl program used to install 1 package)
		we give the package to it and it will install it (it will not search/download dependencies)
		it is used behind the scenes with apt-get or Ubuntu Software center

		if we are using
