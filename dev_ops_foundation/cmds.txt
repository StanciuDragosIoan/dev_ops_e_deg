#CMDS:

	ls (cmd) displays the content of the current directory

	ls /var (displays the contents of the var directory)
	
	pwd (print working directory)

	cd .. (move to parent directory)

	cd ../.. (move 2 directories up)

	launch firefox /usr/bin/firerox (or simply type firefox)
			the 'firefox' cmd works thanks to the path variable (which contains dat)

		echo $PATH (display path)
			the path var contains the locations in which the system will look when we type
			a cmd that is not in its full path

			when I type firefox, browser starts because the location where fiirefox is 		installed is in the $PATH var:
		
	/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
	*usr/bin is there in the $PATH

	*the system will look for the directories in the $PATH var in order 
		first will look in usr/local/sbin, then in usr/local/bin, then usr/sbin, then usr/bin,
		etc... so for instance having 2 programs installed with the same name in 2 different 
		locations in the $PATH, the first one will be ran first 

	the ./test.sh (the . cmd refers to the current path -where I currently am in the folder structure)
	otherwise for test.sh I'd have to run specifying the full path)

	history (prints all cmds)
	history 7 (prints last 7 cmds)
	firefox (runs browser if browser installed in 1 folder in the $path var)
	$firefox &  (break after & runs firefox in backgorund and leaves terminal open)

	press tab for cmd/filename completion

	ctr +a (takes u to the beginning of the row just like home)

	ctr +r (search for a specific cmd type the cmd after ctr+R)
		each time you re-type the cmd will show it with different flags/options

	ctr + t (reverses 2 letters the 1 on which the cursor is and the 1 to its left)

	sudo lshw -C memory (see ram/memory/system details)

	passwd (changes password for a user)

	sudo apt install manpages-posix (install missing man pages)
