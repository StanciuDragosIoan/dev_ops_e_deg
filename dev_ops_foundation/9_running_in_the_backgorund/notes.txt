Running in the background:

    if I open a terminal and type firefox, the browser starts up
        this happens because the firefox is installed in 1 of the directories
        that are in the PATH variable

    next the terminal is 'stuck' I can type commands but they are not executed and 
    I don't have a prompt

    if I type cmds like ls/pwd/cd .. they won't be executed because the process in the 
    terminal is working in the background (the terminal is busy serving my app)

    if I close the browser, the terminal will execute my commands 

    if I run firefox again and type ctr+z this stops the process (browser freezes)
        press fg and process is resumed

    I can start firefox in the background (and still use terminal) by typing:
        firefox & 

            *there is a space after &

            This will start the browser in background and let me still do things in the
            terminal
    


    The Bash Shell
        Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell (it's a GNU alternative to the Bourne Shell which 
        is the default Unix shell)

    It offers command completion and it remembers the history of run commands
        *type tab once to compelte the command or tab  twice to see all the possible cmds

    There are other shells besides Bash in Linux
